# BayesHopperBurst
Gravitational-wave search for generic burst signals in pulsar timing array data. It's conceptually based on the [BayesWave](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bayeswave) algorithm ([ArXiv:1410.3835](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3835)) and uses many routines from [BayesHopper](https://github.com/bencebecsy/BayesHopper) ([ArXiv:1912.08807](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08807))
